# One-Page Investment Memo – Midwest Industrial Solutions (“MIS”)

## Company Snapshot
- **Name:** Midwest Industrial Solutions (“MIS”)
- **Sector:** Specialty industrial components / engineered parts
- **Geography:** Midwest U.S. (HQ Indiana), primarily North American customers
- **Ownership:** Founder-led, privately held
- **Size:** \ revenue / \.2M EBITDA (TTM)

## Thesis Summary (3 bullets)

1. **Niche engineered components with high switching costs** – MIS supplies mission-critical components with tight specifications and long qualification cycles, supporting sticky, recurring revenue from OEM customers.  
2. **Clear margin expansion roadmap** – Current EBITDA margins (~14%) trail best-in-class peers (~18–20%) due to fragmented production planning, suboptimal purchasing, and outdated scheduling systems. Lean initiatives and procurement centralization provide credible uplift.  
3. **Platform for bolt-on M&A** – MIS operates in a fragmented regional market where multiple smaller competitors lack scale. With improved operations and professionalized management, MIS can become a consolidator in adjacent product lines and geographies.

## Key Financials
- **3Y Revenue CAGR:** ~6–7%  
- **EBITDA Margin:** ~14% (target 18–20% with improvements)  
- **FCF Conversion:** ~80–85% of EBITDA (low capex, manageable working capital)  
- **Leverage (pro-forma):** 3.5–4.0x EBITDA under contemplated buyout structure  

## Valuation Snapshot
- **DCF EV Range:** \–95M (base case ~\, 10.5% WACC, 2.5% terminal growth)  
- **Trading Comps Range:** 8.0–10.0x EBITDA for similar niche industrials  
- **Implied Upside/Downside:** ~20–30% IRR potential under base case, with downside protected by durable revenue and low capex requirements.

## Key Risks
- **Customer concentration:** Top 3 customers represent ~40% of revenue; loss or insourcing could materially affect results.  
- **Cyclical end-markets:** Exposure to industrial production cycles and capex budgets of OEMs.  
- **Execution risk on operational improvements:** Margin expansion requires disciplined implementation of lean initiatives and systems upgrades.  

## Recommendation
**Recommendation:** Proceed to deeper diligence and potential LOI.  

Rationale: Strong recurring revenue, credible operational upside, and realistic pathway to bolt-on M&A support attractive risk-adjusted returns. Key diligence areas should include:  
- Depth of customer relationships and renewal dynamics  
- Detailed plant walk-through and capacity analysis  
- Validation of achievable margin targets vs peers  
- Pipeline of bolt-on targets and integration complexity
