## 2. Business Overview
- **Products:** Engineered metal and composite components used in mission-critical assemblies.  
- **Customers:** Diversified OEM base; top 3 customers = ~40% of revenue, each with multi-year relationships.  
- **Geography:** Manufacturing footprint in Indiana; customers primarily in North America.  
- **Business model:** Make-to-spec and make-to-order production, with a mix of long-term contracts and recurring purchase orders.  

MIS has historically been run in a conservative, founder-led manner with limited investment in modern systems or formal operational excellence programs, creating a “self-help” opportunity for a sponsor.

## 3. Industry & Market
The niche industrial components space is:
- **Fragmented:** Multiple small and mid-sized players with overlapping capabilities.  
- **Defensive:** Components are mission-critical; switching vendors requires requalification and engineering time.  
- **Supported by:** Reshoring trends, automation capex, and OEM preferences for reliable, high-quality suppliers.  

Key Observations:
- MIS operates in segments where reliability and delivery performance matter more than pure price competition.  
- There is ongoing consolidation, with scaled platforms achieving higher multiples due to broader capabilities and customer reach.

## 4. Historical Financial Performance
- **Revenue:** ~6–7% CAGR over the last 3 years, driven by increased share of wallet at key customers and modest new wins.  
- **Margins:** EBITDA margin ~14%, below best-in-class peers (18–20%).  
- **Cash Flow:** FCF conversion ~80–85% of EBITDA, with capex at ~2–3% of sales and manageable working capital needs.  

Key Drivers:
- Volume growth tied to OEM production levels.
- Limited pricing power currently exercised, suggesting some overlooked upside.
- Margin drag from unoptimized scheduling, overtime, and fragmented procurement.

## 5. Valuation Summary
DCF (Base Case):
- Revenue growth: 5–6% over next 5 years  
- EBITDA margin: Gradual expansion from 14% ? 18%  
- WACC: 10.5%  
- Terminal growth: 2.5%  

**Implied Enterprise Value:** ~\–95M  
Base case ~\, with IRR in the low-to-mid 20s under moderate leverage and exit at a reasonable multiple.

Trading Comps:
- Niche industrial comps trade at **8–10x EBITDA**.  
- Given size, margin, and platform potential, a **fair entry multiple** is likely in the high-7x to low-9x range, with upside if PE-style value creation is executed.

## 6. Value Creation Plan

1. **Operational Improvement**
   - Implement lean manufacturing principles to reduce scrap, rework, and throughput bottlenecks.  
   - Upgrade scheduling and production planning systems to minimize overtime and expedite costs.  
   - Centralize procurement to leverage volume discounts and standardize inputs.

2. **Commercial & Pricing Optimization**
   - Formalize pricing strategy tied to input costs and value proposition.  
   - Expand wallet share at key customers via engineering collaboration on new components.  

3. **M&A / Buy-and-Build**
   - Identify smaller regional competitors with overlapping or complementary capabilities.  
   - Bolt-ons can provide geographic expansion, product breadth, and cost synergies via consolidation.

## 7. Key Risks & Diligence Items
1. **Customer concentration:** 
   - Need detailed analysis on contract structures, churn history, and competitive alternatives.  
2. **Cyclicality of end markets:** 
   - Assess exposure to industrial downturns and ability to flex cost base.  
3. **Execution risk:** 
   - Margin expansion depends on management’s willingness and capability to adopt operational changes.  
4. **Talent & leadership:** 
   - Evaluate depth of second line management and need for external hires (e.g., VP Operations).

## 8. Conclusion & Recommendation
MIS fits the profile of a **middle-market industrial platform** with:
- Sticky revenue,
- Solid FCF generation,
- Clear and credible value creation levers,
- And a realistic pathway to bolt-on M&A.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to deeper diligence and explore an LOI at an entry valuation consistent with mid-to-high single-digit EBITDA multiples, targeting a 2.5–3.0x MOIC and >20% IRR under the base case.
