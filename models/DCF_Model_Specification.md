# DCF_Model Specification – MIS Example

## Sheets Overview
1. **Inputs & Assumptions**
   - Revenue growth by year
   - EBITDA margin trajectory
   - Capex % of revenue
   - Change in NWC % of revenue
   - Tax rate
   - WACC and terminal growth assumptions

2. **Income Statement Build**
   - Revenue, COGS, gross profit
   - Operating expenses, EBITDA, D&A, EBIT

3. **Unlevered Free Cash Flow**
   - NOPAT (EBIT × (1 – tax rate))
   - + Depreciation & amortization
   - – Capex
   - – Change in NWC
   - Result: Unlevered FCF by year

4. **Valuation**
   - Present value of unlevered FCFs
   - Terminal value via Gordon Growth and/or exit multiple
   - Enterprise value calculation
   - Sensitivity tables (WACC vs terminal growth, WACC vs exit multiple)

5. **Outputs**
   - EV range
   - Implied equity value (if capital structure is modeled)
   - IRR / MOIC under different cases (if integrated with LBO_Lite_Model)

This specification describes how the DCF_Model.xlsx file is structured and can be adapted for new opportunities.
